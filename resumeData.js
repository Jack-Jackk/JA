    "aboutme":"I'm a Jack (literally) of all trades with a combined 5+ years of experience in everything from auto-body work, wildlife removal, towing and trailering boats, customer service, food and bev, and more. Last year I turned to software development as a new challenge in my life and have gained a lot of experience on my own. I'm a quick learner and a hard worker, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a full-stack developer, but I'm also open to internships and contract work.",
